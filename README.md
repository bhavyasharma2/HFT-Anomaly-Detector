# Physics-Informed Stock Price Predictor

## Overview

This project leverages **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to predict stock prices by embedding constraints like **mean-reversion** and other conservation-style laws. The goal is to combine **Physics** and **AI** to create a model that is both data-driven and physically plausible, taking into account the stochastic nature of financial time-series data.

### Key Features:
- Use of PINNs to incorporate physics-based constraints into stock price prediction.
- Data-driven model that utilizes historical stock data.
- Real-time predictions via a **Streamlit** app interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: PyTorch (for implementing the PINN model)
- **App Interface**: Streamlit (for the web app UI)
- **Development Environment**: VSCode, Google Colab (for prototyping)

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you'll need the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch pandas yfinance matplotlib streamlit numpy scipy
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/physics-informed-stock-predictor.git
cd physics-informed-stock-predictor
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the App

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the web app, where you can input a stock ticker symbol and visualize the stock's historical price data along with future predictions.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. The core functionality and PINN model have been designed, but the implementation of data collection, training, and real-time prediction features is still underway. Please check back for updates as new features are integrated.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate more complex physical models, such as **Ornstein–Uhlenbeck** processes for better capturing mean-reversion behavior.
- Expand the model to handle multiple stocks simultaneously and make comparative predictions.
- Deploy the Streamlit app to **Streamlit Cloud** or **Hugging Face Spaces** for public access.
